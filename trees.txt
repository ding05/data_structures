# The following class defines a node in a Fibonacci binary tree. 
define a class: FibNode:
  define a constructor that takes the instance of the object itself and a value n:
    let self.data be n

# The following function builds a Fibonacci binary tree of order n and returns a node with pointers.
define a function: buildFibTree, with the input the order n:
  # The base case: when the order is 0 or 1
  if n is 0 or n is 1:
    let node be FibNode(n)
	return node
  # The recursive process: when the order is greater than 1
